</div>

<p>You want a website. Maybe it is a portfolio, a blog, a small business page, or just a personal site to establish your presence online. And you want to do it for free. And you do not know how to code.</p>

<p>Good news: you can absolutely do this. In 2026, there are more free website builders than ever, and some of them produce genuinely professional results. No coding. No monthly fees. No credit card.</p>

<p>I have built over 120 websites (not a typo) and I can tell you from firsthand experience that the free tools available today would have cost thousands of dollars ten years ago. Let me walk you through every good option and help you pick the right one.</p>

<h2 id="really-free">Can You Really Make a Website for Free?</h2>

<p>Yes, but let me be honest about what "free" means with each platform.</p>

<p><strong>Truly free (no catches):</strong> GitHub Pages, Google Sites, Notion public pages. These are 100% free with no hidden costs. Your site lives on their subdomain (like yourname.github.io) and you never pay anything.</p>

<p><strong>Free tier (with limitations):</strong> Carrd, WordPress.com, Wix, Weebly. These have free plans that work but come with some restrictions -- their branding on your site, limited storage, no custom domain, or fewer features. The free tier is perfectly usable for personal sites and small projects.</p>

<p><strong>Free to use (pay for extras):</strong> Some platforms are free to build on but charge for publishing, custom domains, or removing ads. I will call these out clearly.</p>

<p>The bottom line: you can have a real, live, functioning website online today without spending a single dollar. It will have some limitations compared to a paid hosting setup, but for most people starting out, those limitations do not matter.</p>

<h2 id="github-pages">GitHub Pages (Best Truly Free Option)</h2>

<p>GitHub Pages is what we use for most of our own sites, and it is legitimately the best free hosting available. Here is why.</p>

<p><strong>It is truly free.</strong> No ads on your site. No forced branding. No storage limits within reason (1 GB per repo). Free HTTPS. And here is the big one -- you can connect a custom domain for free. That means you can have yourname.com pointing to a GitHub Pages site without paying for hosting.</p>

<p><strong>You do not need to know how to code.</strong> Yes, GitHub is a code platform. But you do not need to write code from scratch. There are hundreds of free templates you can use. Just fork a template repository, change the text and images to yours, and your site is live.</p>

<p><strong>It is fast and reliable.</strong> GitHub's infrastructure serves your site from a CDN (content delivery network), which means it loads fast from anywhere in the world. The uptime is essentially 100%. Major companies use GitHub Pages for their documentation sites.</p>

<h3>How to Set Up GitHub Pages (No Coding)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a free GitHub account at github.com</li>
<li>Find a free template. Search "GitHub Pages template" or browse themes at themes.github.io or jekyllthemes.io</li>
<li>Fork the template to your account (click the Fork button)</li>
<li>Rename the repository to yourusername.github.io</li>
<li>Edit the content files -- most templates use simple Markdown or HTML that you can edit directly in GitHub's browser editor</li>
<li>Your site is live at yourusername.github.io within minutes</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Who is this for:</strong> Anyone who wants a truly free website with no compromises. Portfolios, blogs, project pages, business landing pages. Especially good for tech-adjacent people who are comfortable with a slight learning curve.</p>

<p>For a detailed tutorial, check out our <a href="https://spunk.codes/blog/github-pages-free-website.html">complete GitHub Pages guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="carrd">Carrd (Best One-Page Site)</h2>

<p>If you just need a single page -- a landing page, a link-in-bio page, a simple portfolio -- Carrd is the fastest way to get it done.</p>

<p><strong>The editor is dead simple.</strong> Pick a template, click on elements to change them, drag to rearrange. No sidebar menus to get lost in. No confusing options. Just click and edit. You can go from zero to a published website in 15 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Free plan limitations:</strong> 3 sites, Carrd branding badge, no custom domain, no forms. The Pro plan is only $19/year (not month -- year) and removes all limitations. For a one-page site, the free plan is usually enough.</p>

<h3>Best Uses for Carrd</h3>
<ul>
<li>Link-in-bio page (like Linktree but better looking and more customizable)</li>
<li>Personal portfolio with project links</li>
<li>Event landing page</li>
<li>Product launch page</li>
<li>Simple business card site</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who is this for:</strong> Anyone who needs a single beautiful page fast. Perfect for freelancers, creators, and small businesses that need a web presence without complexity.</p>

<h3>Free Tools That Actually Help</h3>
<p style="color:#ccc">136+ free premium tools for building and growing your website. No signup required.</p>
<a href="https://spunk.codes/exclusive/">Browse Free Tools &rarr;</a>
</div>

<h2 id="wordpress">WordPress.com (Best for Blogging)</h2>

<p>WordPress powers over 40% of all websites on the internet. The free WordPress.com plan gives you a hosted blog with no setup required.</p>

<p><strong>Important distinction:</strong> WordPress.com (hosted, has a free plan) is different from WordPress.org (self-hosted, requires your own hosting). We are talking about the free WordPress.com version here.</p>

<p><strong>What you get for free:</strong> A blog with dozens of themes, basic customization, 1 GB storage, and a yoursite.wordpress.com subdomain. It is enough for a personal blog or a simple informational site.</p>

<p><strong>Free plan limitations:</strong> WordPress ads show on your site, no custom domain, limited themes, no plugins, 1 GB storage. The Personal plan ($4/month) removes ads and adds a custom domain.</p>

<h3>Best Uses for WordPress.com Free</h3>
<ul>
<li>Personal blog</li>
<li>Writing portfolio</li>
<li>Community or club website</li>
<li>Knowledge base or resource collection</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Who is this for:</strong> Bloggers and writers who want to start publishing immediately without technical setup. If your primary content is written articles, WordPress.com is purpose-built for that.</p>

<h2 id="wix">Wix (Best Drag-and-Drop)</h2>

<p>Wix has the most intuitive drag-and-drop editor of any website builder. You literally drag elements wherever you want them on the page. If you can use PowerPoint, you can use Wix.</p>

<p><strong>What you get for free:</strong> A multi-page website with hundreds of templates, the full drag-and-drop editor, 500 MB storage, and a username.wixsite.com subdomain. Wix also has an AI builder that creates a site for you based on a few questions.</p>

<p><strong>Free plan limitations:</strong> Wix ads on your site, no custom domain, limited storage, no e-commerce. The cheapest paid plan starts around $17/month.</p>

<h3>Why Wix Stands Out</h3>
<p>The template library is massive. There are templates for every imaginable type of website -- restaurants, photographers, musicians, online stores, portfolios, blogs, fitness, real estate, events, and more. Pick one, customize it, and you have a professional-looking site.</p>

<p>The drag-and-drop editor gives you pixel-perfect control. Unlike WordPress where you are limited by the theme structure, Wix lets you put anything anywhere. This is both a strength and a weakness -- it is easy to make something beautiful but also easy to make something messy.</p>

<p><strong>Who is this for:</strong> Visual thinkers who want maximum design control without coding. Small businesses, creative professionals, and anyone who wants a multi-page site with a polished look.</p>

<h2 id="google-sites">Google Sites (Simplest Option)</h2>

<p>If you have a Google account, you already have access to Google Sites. It is the simplest website builder that exists.</p>

<p><strong>What you get:</strong> A basic website builder integrated with Google Drive. Drag in Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Maps, YouTube videos, and Calendar directly. The templates are simple but clean. Completely free with no ads or branding on the free tier.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Very limited design options. No custom code. Simple templates only. Not great for anything that needs to look flashy or unique. But for informational sites, project pages, team wikis, or class websites, it does the job perfectly.</p>

<p><strong>Who is this for:</strong> People who want the absolute simplest path from zero to website. Teachers, students, internal team pages, simple informational sites. If you use Google Workspace, the integration is seamless.</p>

<h2 id="notion">Notion (Best for Documentation and Wikis)</h2>

<p>Notion is not a traditional website builder, but you can publish any Notion page to the web with one click. The result is a clean, readable webpage that looks professional.</p>

<p><strong>What you get:</strong> Your Notion workspace turned into a public website. Great for documentation, knowledge bases, resource collections, portfolios, and wikis. Supports rich content including databases, toggles, galleries, and embedded content.</p>

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Limited design customization (it looks like Notion), no custom domain on the free plan, and the pages load with Notion branding. Third-party tools like Super.so or Potion can add custom domains and styling for a fee.</p>

<p><strong>Who is this for:</strong> People who already use Notion and want to publish some of their content publicly. Great for documentation-heavy sites, resource directories, and personal knowledge bases.</p>

<h2 id="others">More Free Options</h2>

<h3>Webflow (Design-Forward)</h3>
<p>Webflow is a professional web design tool with a generous free tier. You get 2 projects on a webflow.io subdomain. The design capabilities are incredible -- it is the closest thing to coding without writing code. Steep learning curve but produces stunning results. Best for designers who want maximum control.</p>

<h3>Netlify (Static Site Hosting)</h3>
<p>Similar to GitHub Pages but with more features. Free tier includes 100 GB bandwidth per month, continuous deployment from Git, free HTTPS, and custom domains. Great if you are using a static site generator like Hugo, Jekyll, or Eleventy. Also supports server-side functions.</p>

<h3>Cloudflare Pages (Fast and Free)</h3>
<p>Cloudflare's hosting platform is fast and generous. Unlimited bandwidth on the free tier, unlimited sites, automatic deployments from Git, and the speed of Cloudflare's global CDN. Similar to Netlify but potentially faster due to Cloudflare's network.</p>

<h3>Weebly (Simple E-Commerce)</h3>
<p>Weebly is owned by Square and has a decent free tier with drag-and-drop editing and basic e-commerce features. Good if you want to sell a few products from a simple site. The free plan includes Square branding and limited features.</p>

<h3>Strikingly (One-Page Sites)</h3>
<p>Similar to Carrd but with more built-in features in the free tier, including a simple blog, contact forms, and analytics. Limited to one site and Strikingly branding on free plan.</p>

<h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step: Your First Free Website in Under an Hour</h2>

<p>Let me walk you through the fastest path from zero to a live website. We will use Carrd because it is the fastest for beginners.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Go to Carrd.co and Sign Up (2 minutes)</h3>
<p>Create a free account with just an email address. No credit card needed.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Choose a Template (3 minutes)</h3>
<p>Browse the template gallery. There are templates for portfolios, landing pages, link-in-bio pages, and more. Pick one that is close to what you want -- you will customize it next.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Customize Your Content (15-30 minutes)</h3>
<p>Click on any element to edit it. Change the text to your own. Swap out images. Adjust colors if you want. Add or remove sections. Rearrange elements by dragging. The editor shows you exactly what the final site will look like.</p>

<p>For color inspiration, try the <a href="https://spunk.codes/color-palette">Color Palette Generator at spunk.codes</a>. It helps you find colors that work together.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Preview and Publish (2 minutes)</h3>
<p>Click Preview to see how it looks on desktop and mobile. Make any final tweaks. Click Publish. Choose a URL (yourname.carrd.co) and your site is live.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Share It (1 minute)</h3>
<p>Copy the URL and put it in your social media bios, email signature, and anywhere else people might look for you. You now have a website.</p>

<p>Total time: under 30 minutes for a simple site. Under an hour for something more polished.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="custom-domain">Getting a Custom Domain (Optional)</h2>

<p>A custom domain (like yourname.com instead of yourname.carrd.co) makes your site look more professional. Here is how to get one.</p>

<h3>Where to Buy Domains</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Namecheap:</strong> Starts at $8-12/year for .com. Clean interface, no upselling.</li>
<li><strong>Cloudflare Registrar:</strong> At-cost pricing (no markup). Typically $9-10/year for .com.</li>
<li><strong>Google Domains (now Squarespace):</strong> $12/year for .com. Simple management.</li>
<li><strong>Porkbun:</strong> Often the cheapest option. Good interface.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Connecting Your Domain</h3>
<p>With GitHub Pages, you can use a custom domain for free -- just add a CNAME file. With other builders, custom domains usually require a paid plan ($4-$19/month depending on the platform). Cloudflare Pages and Netlify also support free custom domains.</p>

<p>Pro tip: if budget is tight, skip the custom domain for now. A clean subdomain (yourname.github.io) is perfectly fine for starting out. Add a custom domain later when you are ready to invest.</p>

<h2 id="make-it-good">Tips to Make Your Free Site Look Professional</h2>

<p>A free website does not have to look cheap. Follow these tips and nobody will know you did not pay a designer.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Less is more.</strong> The biggest mistake beginners make is cramming too much onto every page. White space (or in dark theme, empty space) makes your content breathe and look professional. When in doubt, remove something.</li>
<li><strong>Stick to two fonts maximum.</strong> One for headings, one for body text. Google Fonts has hundreds of free professional fonts. Inter, Poppins, and Roboto are safe choices for body text. Playfair Display and Montserrat work great for headings.</li>
<li><strong>Use a consistent color palette.</strong> Pick 2-3 colors and use them consistently. The <a href="https://spunk.codes/color-palette">Color Palette Generator</a> at spunk.codes helps you find harmonious colors.</li>
<li><strong>Use high-quality images.</strong> Free stock photos from Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay. Compress them with TinyPNG before uploading so your site loads fast.</li>
<li><strong>Make your text readable.</strong> Body text should be at least 16px. Line height should be 1.5-1.8. Text color should have good contrast against the background. Left-align paragraphs (not centered -- centered body text is hard to read).</li>
<li><strong>Test on mobile.</strong> Over half of all web traffic is mobile. Preview your site on your phone before publishing. Make sure everything is readable and tappable.</li>
<li><strong>Add a clear call to action.</strong> What do you want visitors to do? Contact you? Follow you on social media? Buy something? Make that action obvious with a button or link.</li>
<li><strong>Remove the builder branding if possible.</strong> On some platforms (GitHub Pages, Google Sites, Netlify) there is no branding. On others, upgrading to the cheapest paid plan removes their logo. It makes a big difference in perceived professionalism.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="monetize">How to Make Money From Your Free Website</h2>

<p>Even a free website can generate income. Here are practical ways to monetize.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Affiliate links.</strong> Recommend products and include affiliate links. Amazon Associates (tag=spunk01-20) pays 1-10% commission on purchases. Many software companies pay $50-$200 per referral. Write honest reviews and include your links. Check out the <a href="https://spunk.codes/blog/affiliate-marketing-beginners-guide.html">affiliate marketing beginner guide</a> for details.</li>
<li><strong>Digital products.</strong> Sell ebooks, templates, guides, or printables. Use Gumroad or Lemonsqueezy to handle payments -- they integrate with any website via a simple link.</li>
<li><strong>Services.</strong> Use your site as a portfolio and sell your skills. Freelance writing, design, social media management, virtual assistance. The website builds credibility.</li>
<li><strong>Ad revenue.</strong> Once you get traffic (1,000+ monthly visitors), you can apply for Google AdSense or similar ad networks. Not available on all free hosting platforms but works on GitHub Pages.</li>
<li><strong>Email list.</strong> Build an email list with a free tool like Mailchimp (free up to 500 subscribers) or Buttondown. An email list is a direct line to your audience that you own.</li>
</ul>

<div class="faq">
<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<details open>
<summary>Can you really make a professional website for free?</summary>
<p>Yes. GitHub Pages, Google Sites, and Notion all provide truly free hosting with no ads or branding. Carrd, WordPress.com, and Wix have free tiers with some branding but produce professional-looking results. The tools available for free in 2026 are better than what people paid thousands for a decade ago.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>What is the best free website builder for beginners?</summary>
<p>Carrd for one-page sites (simplest editor). Wix for multi-page sites (best drag-and-drop). WordPress.com for blogs. Google Sites for the absolute simplest option. If you are willing to learn a tiny bit of GitHub, GitHub Pages is the best overall because it has no limitations.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Do free websites rank on Google?</summary>
<p>Yes. Google does not discriminate against free hosting platforms. Your site ranks based on content quality, relevance, and SEO practices -- not how much you paid for hosting. Sites on GitHub Pages, WordPress.com, and other free platforms can and do rank well.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Do I need a custom domain?</summary>
<p>Not to start. A subdomain like yourname.github.io or yourname.carrd.co works fine. A custom domain ($8-$12/year) adds professionalism and is easier to remember. Add one when you are ready, but do not let the cost stop you from launching.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Can I make an online store for free?</summary>
<p>Basic e-commerce is possible with free tiers from Weebly and Big Cartel (up to 5 products free). For selling digital products, Gumroad works with any website -- just link to your Gumroad product page. Full-featured free e-commerce is limited but possible for small sellers.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How long does it take to make a website with no coding?</summary>
<p>A simple one-page site on Carrd takes 15-30 minutes. A multi-page site on Wix takes 1-3 hours. A WordPress blog takes about an hour to set up the basics. GitHub Pages takes 30-60 minutes once you pick a template. You can have a live website today.</p>

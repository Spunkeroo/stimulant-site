<h1>How to Make a Website for Free With No Coding in 2026</h1>
<p><em>Updated February 2026 | By the Stimulant Site team</em></p>

<p>You want a website. Maybe for your business, your portfolio, your blog, or your side project. You don't want to learn HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. And you definitely don't want to pay $30/month for a website builder. I get it.</p>

<p>Good news: in 2026, you can build a legitimately professional website for free, with no coding knowledge, in under an hour. Not a janky Geocities-looking page from 2003. A real, modern, mobile-friendly website that looks like you paid a designer for it.</p>

<p>I've built sites on every free platform available. I'll tell you exactly which one to use for your specific situation, walk you through the setup process, and show you how to avoid the traps that turn "free" into "free trial that costs $16/month."</p>

<h2 id="best-builders">1. The Best Free Website Builders Ranked</h2>

<p>I've tested every major free website builder in 2026. Here they are, ranked by how useful their free plan actually is.</p>

<h3>1. WordPress.com (Best Overall Free Option)</h3>

<p><strong>Free tier includes:</strong> 1GB storage, subdomain (yoursite.wordpress.com), dozens of free themes, basic customization, built-in analytics.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Blogs, personal sites, small business sites.</p>

<p>WordPress.com's free plan is the most feature-rich free website builder. The themes are modern and professional, the editor is intuitive, and you get basic SEO tools built in. The downside: you'll have WordPress.com branding and ads on your site, and you can't install custom plugins on the free plan.</p>

<p>But for a completely free website that looks good and works well, WordPress.com is hard to beat. It powers over 40% of the internet for a reason.</p>

<h3>2. Google Sites (Simplest Free Option)</h3>

<p><strong>Free tier includes:</strong> Unlimited pages, custom domain support, Google Drive integration, no ads, no branding.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Simple informational sites, internal team sites, portfolios.</p>

<p>Google Sites is the most underrated website builder. It's completely free (included with any Google account), has zero ads or branding, and is dead simple to use. The design options are limited compared to other builders, but the sites look clean and professional.</p>

<p>The killer feature: it integrates natively with Google Docs, Sheets, Forms, Calendar, and Drive. You can embed any Google file directly on your page. For businesses already using Google Workspace, this is incredibly convenient.</p>

<h3>3. Carrd (Best for Single-Page Sites)</h3>

<p><strong>Free tier includes:</strong> 3 sites, single-page designs, custom sections, responsive design.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Landing pages, link-in-bio pages, personal branding sites.</p>

<p>If you need a one-page site -- a landing page, a link-in-bio page, or a simple "about me" page -- Carrd is perfect. The free plan lets you build up to 3 beautiful single-page sites. The designs are modern and the builder is incredibly intuitive. You can have a professional-looking page live in 15 minutes.</p>

<h3>4. Wix (Most Design Flexibility)</h3>

<p><strong>Free tier includes:</strong> 500MB storage, 500MB bandwidth, drag-and-drop builder, hundreds of templates, Wix subdomain.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Design-heavy sites, restaurants, photographers, creatives.</p>

<p>Wix gives you the most design freedom of any free builder. The drag-and-drop editor lets you put any element anywhere on the page. The template library is massive. The downside: Wix ads on the free plan are prominent, and the subdomain (username.wixsite.com/sitename) isn't ideal for professional use.</p>

<h3>5. Notion (Surprising Free Option)</h3>

<p><strong>Free tier includes:</strong> Unlimited pages, unlimited blocks, custom subdomain through third-party tools.</p>

<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Documentation, wikis, minimal personal sites, project portfolios.</p>

<p>Notion wasn't designed as a website builder, but with tools like Super.so or Notion's native "Publish to web" feature, you can turn any Notion page into a website. The result is clean, fast, and easy to update. Many indie makers and freelancers use Notion-powered sites.</p>

<h2 id="choose">2. Which Builder to Choose (Decision Tree)</h2>

<p>Still not sure? Answer these questions:</p>

<p><strong>Do you want a blog?</strong> Go with WordPress.com. It's built for blogging and does it better than anyone.</p>

<p><strong>Do you just need a single page (landing page, link-in-bio)?</strong> Go with Carrd. It's the fastest path to a beautiful one-pager.</p>

<p><strong>Do you want the simplest possible setup with no ads?</strong> Go with Google Sites. Free, ad-free, and dead simple.</p>

<p><strong>Do you want maximum design control?</strong> Go with Wix. The drag-and-drop builder gives you pixel-level control.</p>

<p><strong>Do you want something minimal that you can update easily?</strong> Go with Notion + Super.so. Write in Notion, publish to the web.</p>

<p><strong>Do you want an online store?</strong> None of the free builders offer truly free ecommerce. Your best bet is a free Ecwid account (sell up to 5 products for free) embedded on any of these builders. Or use Gumroad for digital products.</p>

<h2 id="step-by-step">3. Step-by-Step: Build Your Site in 60 Minutes</h2>

<p>I'll walk through building a site on WordPress.com since it's the most versatile option. The process is similar on other platforms.</p>

<h3>Minutes 1-5: Create Your Account</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to wordpress.com and click "Start your website"</li>
<li>Create a free account with email, Google, or Apple</li>
<li>Choose the free plan (it will try to upsell you -- click "start with a free site" at the bottom)</li>
<li>Pick your subdomain name (choose carefully, this is your URL)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Minutes 5-15: Choose and Customize Your Theme</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to Appearance > Themes</li>
<li>Filter by "Free" and browse until you find one that fits your vibe</li>
<li>Click "Activate" on your chosen theme</li>
<li>Go to Customize to adjust colors, fonts, and layout</li>
<li>Upload your logo if you have one (make a free one at Canva if you don't)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Minutes 15-35: Create Your Pages</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to Pages > Add New</li>
<li>Create your Home page with a headline, description, and call-to-action</li>
<li>Create your About page (who you are, what you do, why people should care)</li>
<li>Create a Contact page (use the built-in contact form block)</li>
<li>Create any additional pages specific to your needs</li>
</ol>

<h3>Minutes 35-50: Add Content and Media</h3>
<ol>
<li>Add images to your pages (use free stock photos from Unsplash or Pexels if you don't have your own)</li>
<li>Write compelling text for each section (keep it clear and concise)</li>
<li>Add buttons with calls-to-action</li>
<li>Set up your navigation menu under Appearance > Menus</li>
</ol>

<h3>Minutes 50-60: Final Touches</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preview your site on both desktop and mobile</li>
<li>Fix any layout issues on mobile (most themes handle this automatically)</li>
<li>Set your homepage under Settings > Reading</li>
<li>Write your site title and tagline under Settings > General</li>
<li>Hit publish and your site is live</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="pages">4. Essential Pages Every Website Needs</h2>

<p>Regardless of what your site is for, these pages are must-haves.</p>

<p><strong>Home page:</strong> Your visitor's first impression. It should clearly communicate what your site is about within 5 seconds. Include a headline, a brief description, and a clear call to action (what do you want visitors to do next?).</p>

<p><strong>About page:</strong> People want to know who's behind the website. Share your story, your mission, and what makes you different. This is consistently one of the most visited pages on any website.</p>

<p><strong>Contact page:</strong> Make it easy for people to reach you. Include a contact form, email address, and social media links. If you have a physical location, add your address and a Google Maps embed.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy policy:</strong> If you collect any data (even just through analytics), you need a privacy policy. Use a free generator like PrivacyPolicies.com or Termly.io to create one.</p>

<h2 id="design">5. Design Tips for Non-Designers</h2>

<p>You don't need a design degree to make a professional-looking website. Follow these rules and you'll be fine.</p>

<p><strong>Use lots of white space.</strong> The #1 mistake on amateur websites is cramming everything together. Give your content room to breathe. When in doubt, add more space between elements.</p>

<p><strong>Stick to 2-3 colors.</strong> Pick a primary color, a secondary color, and a neutral. Use them consistently across your entire site. If you need help choosing colors, Coolors.co generates beautiful color palettes for free.</p>

<p><strong>Use no more than 2 fonts.</strong> One for headings, one for body text. Google Fonts is free and most website builders integrate with it. Safe choices: Inter, Open Sans, Lato, or Roboto for body text. Playfair Display, Montserrat, or Poppins for headings.</p>

<p><strong>Use high-quality images.</strong> Blurry or pixelated images instantly make a site look amateur. Use free stock photos from Unsplash (unsplash.com) or Pexels (pexels.com). Both are completely free for commercial use.</p>

<p><strong>Align everything consistently.</strong> If your heading is left-aligned, your body text should be left-aligned too. Consistency creates visual harmony. Most website builders handle this through templates, but double-check when you customize.</p>

<p><strong>Make buttons look clickable.</strong> Buttons should have a contrasting color, rounded corners, and enough padding. The button text should be action-oriented: "Get Started," "Contact Us," "Learn More" -- not "Click Here."</p>

<p>A good <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=web+design+book+beginners&tag=spunk01-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web design book for beginners</a> can level up your design sense if you want to go deeper.</p>

<h2 id="seo">6. Free SEO Basics</h2>

<p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is how people find your website through Google. Here are the free basics that make a real difference.</p>

<p><strong>Write a clear page title and meta description</strong> for every page. The title shows up as the clickable headline in Google results. The meta description is the two lines of text below it. Make them descriptive and include your target keywords naturally.</p>

<p><strong>Use headings properly.</strong> Your page should have one H1 (main heading), then H2s for sections, H3s for subsections. This helps Google understand your page structure.</p>

<p><strong>Optimize images.</strong> Compress images before uploading (TinyPNG.com is free). Add descriptive alt text to every image. Large, unoptimized images slow down your site, which hurts your Google ranking.</p>

<p><strong>Write useful content.</strong> Google's algorithm is sophisticated enough to reward genuinely helpful content. Write for humans first, search engines second. Answer the questions your target audience is asking.</p>

<p><strong>Submit your sitemap to Google.</strong> Go to Google Search Console (free), verify your site, and submit your sitemap. This tells Google your site exists and helps it get indexed faster.</p>

<h2 id="analytics">7. Adding Free Analytics</h2>

<p>Once your site is live, you want to know who's visiting and what they're doing. Here's how to track everything for free.</p>

<p><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> The industry standard, completely free. WordPress.com includes basic analytics on the free plan. For other builders, you may need the paid plan to add Google Analytics code, but there are workarounds (like using Google Tag Manager through a custom code embed).</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft Clarity:</strong> A free heatmap and session recording tool. It shows you exactly where people click, how far they scroll, and where they get stuck. This is incredibly useful for improving your site's design and user experience.</p>

<p><strong>Google Search Console:</strong> Free tool that shows you which Google searches bring people to your site, how often your site appears in search results, and any technical issues Google finds. Essential for SEO.</p>

<h2 id="domain">8. Custom Domains (Free and Cheap Options)</h2>

<p>Your free site will have a subdomain like yoursite.wordpress.com or yoursite.wixsite.com. If you want a custom domain like yoursite.com, here are your options.</p>

<p><strong>Free domain options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Freenom offers free .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, and .gq domains. They're free but look unprofessional. Fine for personal projects, not great for businesses.</li>
<li>GitHub Pages gives you a free yourname.github.io domain that's actually respectable in tech circles.</li>
<li>Some hosting providers include a free domain with paid hosting plans.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cheap domain options:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Namecheap offers .com domains starting around $8-10/year.</li>
<li>Google Domains (now Squarespace Domains) charges $12/year for .com with free WHOIS privacy.</li>
<li>Cloudflare Registrar sells domains at wholesale cost with no markup.</li>
</ul>

<p>A custom domain is the one thing I'd say is worth spending money on, even if everything else is free. It makes your site look professional and it's yours forever (as long as you renew).</p>

<h2 id="mistakes">9. Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<p><strong>Choosing a builder based on the template, not the platform.</strong> Templates can be changed. Platform features can't. Choose the builder with the features you need, then pick a template.</p>

<p><strong>Making the site about you instead of your visitor.</strong> Your homepage headline shouldn't be "Welcome to My Website." It should tell visitors what you can do for them. "Handmade Jewelry Shipped Free" is better than "Sarah's Jewelry Shop."</p>

<p><strong>Ignoring mobile.</strong> Over 60% of web traffic is mobile. Always preview your site on a phone before launching. If something looks broken on mobile, fix it before anything else.</p>

<p><strong>Loading too many images and animations.</strong> Every image and animation slows your site down. A slow site loses visitors (47% of people expect a page to load in 2 seconds or less) and gets penalized by Google. Keep it simple and fast.</p>

<p><strong>Forgetting to update.</strong> A website with a copyright year from 2023 and a blog last updated 18 months ago looks abandoned. Either keep it updated or don't include dates at all.</p>

<p><strong>Not having a clear call to action.</strong> Every page should guide visitors to do something: contact you, read more, sign up, buy something. If a visitor reaches the bottom of a page and doesn't know what to do next, you've lost them.</p>

<h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<div class="faq">
<details>
<summary>Can I really make a professional website for free?</summary>
<p>Yes, with some limitations. Free website builders like WordPress.com, Google Sites, and Carrd give you genuinely professional-looking results. The main limitations are: you'll likely have a subdomain (not yoursite.com), some platforms show ads or their branding, and you won't have access to advanced features like ecommerce or custom code. For a personal site, portfolio, blog, or simple business site, free is absolutely sufficient.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What's the catch with free website builders?</summary>
<p>The builders make money from their paid plans. The free tier is designed to get you started and hope you'll upgrade when you need more features. Common limitations on free plans: subdomain only, limited storage, platform branding/ads, no ecommerce, no custom code, and limited customer support. But for many use cases, the free tier is all you need.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need hosting if I use a free website builder?</summary>
<p>No. Free website builders include hosting as part of the package. Your site lives on their servers and they handle all the technical stuff: uptime, security, backups, and server maintenance. This is one of the biggest advantages of using a website builder over building from scratch.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I sell things on a free website?</summary>
<p>Direct ecommerce on free website builder plans is limited. However, you can embed payment links from PayPal, Stripe, or Gumroad on any website. You can also add Ecwid's free ecommerce widget (allows up to 5 products for free). For digital products, Gumroad lets you sell for free (they take a small percentage per sale). So yes, you can sell things -- you just need to get creative with your tools.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How long does it take to build a website with no coding?</summary>
<p>A simple site can be live in 30-60 minutes using a template. A more polished site with custom content, images, and multiple pages takes 2-4 hours. A full business site with an about page, services, testimonials, blog, and contact form might take a weekend of focused work. The first site is always the slowest. Once you understand the builder, future sites are much faster.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Will my free website show up on Google?</summary>
<p>Yes, but it takes time. Google needs to discover and index your site, which can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. Submit your sitemap through Google Search Console to speed up the process. Free sites rank just as well as paid sites in Google's algorithm -- the ranking factors are content quality, relevance, and user experience, not how much you paid for hosting.</p>
</details>
</div>

<h2>Just Build It</h2>

<p>The best website is the one that exists. Don't spend weeks researching the "perfect" platform. Pick one from this list, spend an hour building your site, and publish it. You can always change things later. You can always switch platforms later. But you can't benefit from a website that only exists in your head.</p>

<p>Start with WordPress.com if you're not sure. Start with Carrd if you just need a simple page. Start with Google Sites if you want something quick and ad-free. The point is to start.</p>

<p>Your website is your home on the internet. In 2026, there's no reason not to have one. It's free, it's easy, and it takes less time than watching a movie. Go build something.</p>

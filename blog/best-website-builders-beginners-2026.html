Its drag-and-drop editor requires zero coding knowledge, offers 900+ templates, and includes AI-powered site generation that creates a custom website from a text description. Squarespace is a close second with more polished design templates but a slightly steeper learning curve."}},
      {"@type":"Question","name":"How much does a website builder cost per month?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Website builder pricing ranges from free (with limitations) to $45+ per month. Wix starts at $17/month for a basic plan with custom domain. Squarespace starts at $16/month. WordPress.com starts at $4/month but the Business plan at $33/month is needed for plugins. Most beginners spend $15-25/month for a professional website with custom domain and no ads."}},
      {"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need coding skills to build a website?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. Modern website builders like Wix, Squarespace, and Shopify are designed specifically for people with no coding experience.

Coding knowledge is only needed for highly custom functionality."}},
      {"@type":"Question","name":"Which website builder is best for selling products?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Shopify is the best website builder for selling physical products, with built-in inventory management, shipping calculators, and 100+ payment gateways. For digital products, Squarespace and Wix both offer strong e-commerce features. For a full online store with more than 50 products, Shopify's dedicated e-commerce infrastructure is worth the higher cost."}},
      {"@type":"Question","name":"Can I switch website builders later?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Switching website builders is possible but not seamless. Your domain name transfers easily, but your site design, content layout, and some functionality will need to be recreated on the new platform. Most builders do not export designs in a format compatible with other platforms. Choose carefully upfront, as migration requires significant effort. WordPress offers the most portability since you own all your content and can move between hosts."}}

  <h2 id="choosing">How to Choose a Website Builder</h2>
  <p>The best website builder depends entirely on what you need it for. A portfolio site has different requirements than an online store, and a blog needs different features than a business landing page. Before comparing platforms, answer these three questions.</p>
  <p><strong>What is the primary purpose?</strong> Portfolio and personal sites: Squarespace or Carrd. Business websites: Wix or WordPress. Online stores: Shopify or Squarespace Commerce. Blogs: WordPress or Ghost. Each platform excels in specific use cases and compromises in others.</p>
  <p><strong>What is your technical comfort level?</strong> If you have never built a website, choose Wix or Squarespace for their visual, drag-and-drop editors. If you are comfortable with moderate complexity and want more control, choose WordPress. If you want complete design freedom and are willing to learn, choose Webflow.</p>
  <p><strong>What is your budget?</strong> Free options exist but come with significant limitations: builder branding on your site, no custom domain, limited storage, and restricted features. Plan to spend $15 to $30 per month for a professional website. This includes hosting, a custom domain, SSL certificate, and access to the full feature set.</p>

  </div>

  <h2 id="wix">Wix: Best Overall for Beginners</h2>
  <p>Wix is the most beginner-friendly website builder available in 2026. Its drag-and-drop editor allows you to place any element anywhere on the page with no coding required. The platform has evolved significantly from its early days and now offers AI-powered site generation, a robust app marketplace, and solid SEO tools.</p>
  <p><strong>Wix ADI (Artificial Design Intelligence)</strong> can create a complete website from a brief text description. You answer a few questions about your business, choose a style, and the AI generates a fully designed site with relevant content, images, and layout. You then customize from there. For absolute beginners, this eliminates the blank-page problem entirely.</p>
  <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Light plan at $17/month includes a custom domain, 2GB storage, and removes Wix branding. Core plan at $29/month adds 50GB storage, e-commerce basics, and analytics. Business plan at $36/month adds unlimited storage and advanced e-commerce. Annual billing saves roughly 20%.</p>
  <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Wix sites are not portable. You cannot export your site design to another platform. Template switching after building is limited. Page load speeds, while improved, still lag behind Squarespace and WordPress on average. For simple websites, these limitations rarely matter. For growing businesses expecting to scale significantly, consider WordPress for its long-term flexibility.</p>

  <h2 id="squarespace">Squarespace: Best for Design</h2>
  <p>Squarespace produces the most visually polished websites of any builder. Every template is designed to professional standards, and the structured editor prevents design mistakes that plague freeform builders. If aesthetics matter to your brand, Squarespace is the clear choice.</p>
  <p><strong>Template quality:</strong> Squarespace offers approximately 150 templates, far fewer than Wix, but every single one is portfolio-quality. The templates are responsive, modern, and customizable within a structured framework that maintains design integrity even as you modify colors, fonts, and layouts. Photographers, artists, designers, and restaurants consistently choose Squarespace for this reason.</p>
  <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Personal plan at $16/month includes a custom domain, unlimited bandwidth, and basic site features. Business plan at $33/month adds e-commerce, CSS/JavaScript customization, and professional email. Commerce Basic at $36/month adds full e-commerce with no transaction fees. Annual billing reduces prices by roughly 25%.</p>
  <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> The structured editor limits creative freedom compared to Wix's freeform approach. You cannot place elements wherever you want; you work within the template's grid system. This is actually a benefit for beginners (it prevents design mistakes), but advanced users may find it constraining. Third-party integrations are more limited than WordPress or Wix.</p>

  <h2 id="wordpress">WordPress.com: Best for Flexibility</h2>
  <p>WordPress powers 43% of all websites on the internet, from personal blogs to Fortune 500 corporate sites. WordPress.com (the hosted version) offers the power of WordPress without the server management complexity of self-hosted WordPress.org.</p>
  <p><strong>Why WordPress wins long-term:</strong> WordPress is the only major builder where you truly own your content and can move it anywhere. The plugin ecosystem (60,000+ plugins) provides functionality for virtually anything: SEO, e-commerce, memberships, forums, courses, booking systems, and more. As your needs grow, WordPress grows with you without requiring a platform migration.</p>
  <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free plan exists but is severely limited. Personal plan at $4/month for basic sites. Premium at $8/month for advanced design. Business at $33/month for plugin access and advanced features. eCommerce at $45/month for full store functionality. The Business plan is the sweet spot for most users who want the full WordPress experience.</p>
  <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> WordPress has a steeper learning curve than Wix or Squarespace. The dashboard is more complex, and achieving a polished design without a premium theme requires more effort. Plugin management adds maintenance overhead. For beginners who want to launch a simple site quickly, WordPress may feel overwhelming initially.</p>

  <h2 id="shopify">Shopify: Best for E-Commerce</h2>
  <p>If your primary goal is selling products online, Shopify is purpose-built for e-commerce in ways that general website builders cannot match. Inventory management, shipping integration, tax calculation, and payment processing are native features, not add-ons.</p>
  <p><strong>E-commerce advantages:</strong> Shopify handles the complex parts of online selling that general builders struggle with. Automatic tax calculations for multiple jurisdictions. Real-time shipping rate calculation from major carriers. Inventory tracking across multiple locations. Abandoned cart recovery emails. Multi-channel selling (website, Instagram, Facebook, Amazon) from a single dashboard.</p>
  <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Basic plan at $39/month with 2% transaction fee on non-Shopify Payments transactions. Shopify plan at $105/month with 1% fee and more features. Advanced at $399/month for enterprise features. Shopify Starter at $5/month lets you sell through social media and messaging without a full website.</p>

  <h2 id="webflow">Webflow: Best for Advanced Users</h2>
  <p>Webflow bridges the gap between no-code builders and custom development. It generates clean, semantic HTML and CSS from a visual editor, giving designers the creative freedom of custom code without writing it. The learning curve is steeper than other builders, but the output quality is professional-grade.</p>
  <p><strong>Who Webflow is for:</strong> Designers who want pixel-perfect control. Agencies building client sites. Developers who prefer visual tools over hand-coding. Anyone who has outgrown the limitations of Wix or Squarespace but does not want to manage WordPress. Webflow is not for complete beginners; it assumes some understanding of web design concepts like flexbox, padding, and responsive design.</p>
  <p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free plan for learning (2 projects, webflow.io subdomain). Basic site plan at $18/month. CMS plan at $29/month for dynamic content. Business plan at $49/month for advanced features. The free plan is genuinely useful for learning the platform before committing financially.</p>

  <h2 id="free">Best Free Website Builders</h2>
  <p>Free website builders work for personal projects, testing ideas, and learning. They are not suitable for businesses because they include builder branding, lack custom domains, and offer limited features.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Carrd:</strong> The best free option for single-page sites. Clean, fast, responsive one-page sites with a free plan that includes 3 sites. Pro plan at $19/year is remarkably affordable for the quality offered.</li>
    <li><strong>WordPress.com Free:</strong> Basic blogging with WordPress branding and limited customization. Good for personal blogs. Upgrade to remove ads and get a custom domain.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Sites:</strong> Simple, no-frills sites integrated with Google Workspace. Free with any Google account. Best for internal team sites or very simple informational pages.</li>
    <li><strong>GitHub Pages:</strong> Free static site hosting for developers. Requires HTML/CSS knowledge. Zero cost for unlimited traffic. Best for developer portfolios and documentation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="compare">Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>
  <p>Here is how each platform compares on the factors that matter most to beginners.</p>
  <p><strong>Ease of use:</strong> Wix (easiest) &gt; Squarespace &gt; WordPress.com &gt; Shopify &gt; Webflow (most complex)</p>
  <p><strong>Design quality:</strong> Squarespace (best) &gt; Webflow &gt; Wix &gt; Shopify &gt; WordPress.com</p>
  <p><strong>E-commerce:</strong> Shopify (best) &gt; Squarespace &gt; Wix &gt; WordPress.com &gt; Webflow</p>
  <p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> WordPress.com (best) &gt; Webflow &gt; Wix &gt; Squarespace &gt; Shopify</p>
  <p><strong>Value for money:</strong> Squarespace (best) &gt; Wix &gt; WordPress.com &gt; Shopify &gt; Webflow</p>
  <p><strong>SEO capabilities:</strong> WordPress.com (best) &gt; Squarespace &gt; Wix &gt; Webflow &gt; Shopify</p>

  <h2 id="domain">Choosing and Connecting a Domain</h2>
  <p>Your domain name is your web address (like yourbusiness.com). Most website builders offer a free domain for the first year when you sign up for an annual plan. After the first year, expect to pay $12 to $20 per year for domain renewal.</p>
  <p><strong>Domain tips:</strong> Choose a .com extension if available, as it remains the most trusted and memorable. Keep the name short (under 15 characters), easy to spell, and easy to say aloud. Avoid hyphens and numbers. Check that your desired name is available on social media platforms before committing. Register through your builder for simplicity, or through Namecheap or Cloudflare Registrar for the lowest renewal prices.</p>

  <h2 id="mistakes">Mistakes Beginners Make</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Choosing based on price alone.</strong> The cheapest plan is rarely the best value. Free plans have limitations that frustrate users into upgrading anyway. Choose based on your actual needs, then find the best price for that feature set.</li>
    <li><strong>Over-designing the site.</strong> Simple, clean designs convert better than complex ones. Use white space generously. Limit fonts to 2. Limit colors to 3 (primary, accent, background). Every element should serve a purpose.</li>
    <li><strong>Ignoring mobile responsiveness.</strong> Over 60% of web traffic is mobile. Preview your site on mobile before publishing. All major builders offer mobile preview modes. Use them.</li>
    <li><strong>Skipping SEO basics.</strong> Set page titles, meta descriptions, alt text for images, and a logical URL structure from day one. These basics are easy to do during building and painful to retrofit later.</li>
    <li><strong>Not having clear calls to action.</strong> Every page should tell the visitor what to do next. Contact you. Buy a product. Subscribe to a newsletter. Read another page. Without clear direction, visitors leave.</li>
  </ul>
